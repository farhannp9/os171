a. What are the differences about the code and the output from both program? 
They have different address yet the only difference is that two are local variables and the others are global variables
b. Why Global Variable Address number and Local Variable Address number have a great difference in their address? 
Local variables are stored at the end of the memory because they are only to be used temporarily
c. Write your knowledge about Global Variable Address and Local Variable Address (don't forget to add the sources if you use reference)
Local variable are assigned memory at the call of function, as a result, each recursive calls to the same local variables are distinctly stored (Wikipedia)



a) Explain the parameter of flags in open function that used in the code !
Int flags = determine the action for the file (to be read only, write only, etc)
b) Explain the parameter of modes in open function that used in the code ! 
Mode = determine who has access to the file and what type of access
c) Write your knowledge about open and close I/O process (don't forget to add the sources if you use reference)
Const char *pathname = stored addres of the file

. Write your knowledge about the write program on lab04.txt point number 3
